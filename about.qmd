title: "About this Project"
---

This project is the result of a meaningful collaboration across The Nature Conservancy, and serves as an demonstration of data products that may be created using LANDFIRE data. These charts, maps, and graphs are based on current LANDFIRE products, and provide a starting point for further analysis. All maps, input datasets and further assistance can be obtained by contacting the author, [Randy Swaty](mailto:rswaty@tnc.org){target="blank"}.

## The Nature Conservancy & LANDFIRE

LANDFIRE, Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools, is a shared program between the wildland fire management programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and The Nature Conservancy, that provides landscape-scale geo-spatial products, vegetation models and tools to support cross-boundary planning, management, and operations.

The Nature Conservancy supports LANDFIRE through

LANDFIRE provides 25+ national geo-spatial layers (e.g. vegetation, fuel, disturbance, etc.), databases, and ecological models that are available to the public for the U.S. and insular areas. These nationwide geospatial data products reflect current and historic conditions and include ecosystem dynamic models that can be used for conservation, fire planning, and land management decisions.

## Biophysical Settings Products

#### Quick intro

A Biophysical Setting (BpS) is a concept that represents the vegetation that may have been dominant on the landscape prior to European colonization of North America and is based on both the current biophysical environment and an approximation of the historical disturbance regime.

LANDFIRE collaborated with experts around the country to create a description and model for every BpS it mapped across the US.

Check out the vegetation modeling website to learn how to integrate BpS into your work.

## Vegetation Products

#### Quick Intro

LANDFIRE (LF) existing vegetation layers describe the following elements: Existing Vegetation Type (EVT), Existing Vegetation Canopy Cover (EVC), and Existing Vegetation Height (EVH). These layers are created using predictive landscape models based on extensive field-referenced data, satellite imagery and biophysical gradient layers using classification and regression trees.'
